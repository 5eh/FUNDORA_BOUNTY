# Welcome!

Hey, thank you all for joining and wanting to participate in this mini-bounty search.

Here's a bit about what we're doing if you're interested in learning more:
We're using the Wyoming State backed stablecoin to provide micro-FACTs (an alternative of loans) to small businesses, freelancers, and a variety of individuals who face hardship when seeking and requesting funding. We try to enable this through the following smart contracts found inside of this repository.

We aim to achieve three main results from this bounty test:

1. Seek and prevent possible bug exploits in our smart contracts.
2. Identify ease of use for these smart contracts on a developer focused aspect.
3. Improve our contract architecture with your help.

Although we may not have the biggest reward pot, we hope to be able to issue all or close to $1,000 USD. Optimistically, we want to ensure a fair playing field for everyone, and so, if you and others identify the same issue, we will distribute the prize earnings if they are the exact same bug or fundamentally the same critical issue.

There is no real set amount of bugs nor issues we hope to identify, but the Fundora team is responsible for a fair payout for the developers eligible.

## Bug identification and reward pot

| Severity | Total amount | Description                                                                                                                           |
| -------- | ------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| LOW      | $200         | Low hanging fruit issues, or simple optimizations to the contract that improves the utility and ease of use                           |
| MEDIUM   | $300         | More efficient techniques of the contract that can prevent bugs, or improve upgradability, and prevent data losses or issues with KYC |
| HIGH     | $500         | Contract breaking functionality that may break or manipulate users or funding providers wallets                                       |

If there is multiple of the same bug that is found, the payment amount will be distributed fairly between the developers who show light to this problem. If there is a direct solution included, then we may provide a little additional funds for your efforts.

### Additional rewards

As we acknowledge that the funds may not be exceptional or compelling with your time commitment (of whatever amount of hours you wish to put in) and as there is multiple developers taking a peak, we want to additionally offer the following, as non-financial incentives:

1. An NFT or POAP (Your choice) for your participation
2. Recognition on the [Website](https://beta.fundora.biz)
3. Recognition to your efforts on [LinkedIn](https://linkedin.com/in/watsonlr)
4. Optional inclusive efforts from our end to help you: 1. Audit your own contracts (on request), 2. Get free user testing (for your applications or ideas), and/or 3. Review of documentation (for your applications or ideas)
5. Possible future contracting opportunities for additional income
6. Early access to AirDrops or related financial incentives Fundora offers
7. Appreciation posts on our personal socials
